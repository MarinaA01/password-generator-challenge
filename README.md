# password-generator-challenge

## Description
My motivation for this project was to provide a simple password generator for anyone who wants inspiration for a simple JavaScript project. This password generator uses JavaScript to generate passwords with certain rules including special characters, numbers, and lowercase or uppercase letters. Once "Generate Password" is clicked it will ask the length you want and what character type you'd prefer.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This password generator can be used by clicking on the "generate password" button. Once clicked, prompts will appear that will ask you the length of your desired passwords and what character type you'd like including special characters, numeric, lowercase, and uppercase characters.
